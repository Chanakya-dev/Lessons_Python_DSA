# Classes and Objects

## Concepts
- Defining Classes
- Attributes and Methods
- Constructor (`__init__` method)
- `self` keyword
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism (Method Overriding)
- Static and Class Methods

## Problems
- Create a class `Circle` with attributes radius and methods to calculate area and circumference.
- Implement a class `Rectangle` to calculate area and perimeter.
- Write a class `Student` with attributes name, age, and marks, and a method to display student details.
- Implement a class `BankAccount` with methods to deposit, withdraw, and check balance.
- Create a class `Book` with attributes like title, author, and price, and a method to display details.
- Define a class `Employee` with attributes like name and salary, and implement a method to calculate bonuses.
- Implement inheritance: Create a base class `Vehicle` and derived classes like `Car` and `Bike` with additional attributes and methods.
- Write a program to demonstrate method overriding in Python using classes `Parent` and `Child`.
- Create a class `Calculator` with static methods to perform basic arithmetic operations.
- Implement a class `Student` with a class method to count the total number of students created.
- Demonstrate encapsulation by creating a class with private attributes and getter/setter methods.
- Define a class `Person` with a method to calculate BMI (Body Mass Index) using weight and height.
- Create a class `Library` that allows users to add books, borrow books, and return books.
- Implement a polymorphism example by defining a method `draw` in multiple classes like `Circle`, `Rectangle`, and `Triangle`.
- Write a class `Queue` to implement a basic queue with methods for enqueue, dequeue, and checking if the queue is empty.
